                <h2>LOVERS Boat Tour</h2>
                <p>In this time of the year the evenings are becoming darker quicker and Amsterdam starts to get beautiful light artworks all around the city. This boat tour takes you on a journey where you fall in love with Amsterdam's night view and watch the Amsterdam Light Festival. Instead of having to walk for a whole day to see all the artworks, you can just relax and sit for an hour in a boat and see everything. This is also a good date idea as the views are very romantic.</p>
